# Space Race IBM DATA SCIENCE CAPSTONE PROJECT USING PYTHON

Winning Space Race with data science

This is an IBM Data Science Capstone Project. In this project,I am taking the role of a data scientist working for a new rocket company, called SpaceY that would like to compete with SpaceX founded by Billionaire industrialist Allon Musk. my job is to use data science instead of rocket science to discover the possibility of competing with SpaceX. I am doing this by gathering information about SpaceX, performing data analytics, modeling ML algorithms and creating dashboards for my team.
